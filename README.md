# The project:

-- Create a website where clients can book a band simply. The band agents can quickly and easily make the line up through a tree system of booking.

-- The client books their preferred singer and band size/instrumentation. The singer has their list of preferred musicians in order of prefereance and then
the system outputs singer and band members.

-- This process takes all the time consuming effort out of booking a band.

# Deliverables of the project:
