# Available on Heroku:

# The project:

-- Create a website where clients can book a band simply. The band agents can quickly and easily make the 'line up' through a tree system of booking.

-- The client books their preferred singer and band size/instrumentation, this automatically produces an event with Band size and singer involved. Every event may be edited.

-- This process takes all the time consuming effort out of booking a band.

# Challanges.

-- Keeping 'scope creep' of the project at bay and prioritizing features.

-- Working with MUI, although a very useful often was difficult to implement early on. Over time this became easier.

-- Deploying to Heroku the application failed to build and required 4 or 5 attempts at debugging to bring into production.

-- Database 'JOIN' was met with issues in defining ID and table content.

# Deliverables of the project:

-- An application where a user can browse different singers/artist and choose thir band size.

-- A form to enter details into for the client to register their events.

-- Admin features which offer the ability to edit events, users, and artists.

# How to use:

-- Create an event as a 'client' and fill in the Create Event form.

-- Access the Admin side by signing in as an administrative user and follow the navigation to edit the data of the site.

# Future Updates:

-- The singer has their list of preferred musicians in order of prefereance and then the system outputs singer and band members through automated emails.

-- A song list is added where clients can choose their set lists from the menu available.

-- Short recorded clips of individual singers.
